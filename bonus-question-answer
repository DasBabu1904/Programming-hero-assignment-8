how react works?
answer:
react is js library but not a framewrok. JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension used in React element creation. We can employ it to embed HTML code in JavaScript objects.JSX accepts valid JavaScript expressions and function embedding, it is a simplification  complex code structures.React dose not rerender the full DOM instead it creates a virtual copy of dom and then work with it. It is called DOM tree. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and itâ€™s worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speed up its manipulation.

Props V/S States: 
answer:
1.Props are read-only.We can cont modify them  But State changes can be asynchronous.
2.Props are immutable(ie. we can not update) But	State is mutable.
3.Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument but State holds information about anything related to the site and which can change dynamically.
4.Props can be accessed by the child component.	State cannot be accessed by child components unless it used as a props.
5.Props are used to communicate between components.	States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.
